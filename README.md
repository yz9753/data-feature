## Prerequisites 

To run this notebook, you need to set up API keys for:

Alpha Vantage API (for stock ticker to company name conversion)
New York Times API (for article search)
Make sure to add these API keys to the SECRETS tab in Google Colab.


## Usage

1. Run the notebook cells in order.
2. When prompted, enter a meal name (e.g., pasta).
3. The notebook will display the recipe's website, ingredient list, calories for each ingredient and then the total calories of the meal 


## Note

This is a prototype for educational purposes. In a real-world application, additional features such as a user interface, ability to add/remove tickers, financial metrics, and robust error handling would be implemented.
